# Ricekit core
Provides base container for creating ricings with [Ricekit](https://github.com/ricekit/ricekit).
This container is not designed to be pulled directly but should be used as a base image
for other containers that contain a `ricing.yaml` file to define the structure.

It contains various scripts that are used to manipulate existing ricings so that they
can be used with Ricekit. This allows the ricing creator to use any software necessary to customise
the configuration files as needed without having it installed on the users host system.
